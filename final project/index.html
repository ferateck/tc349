					<h1>WELCOME.</h1>
					<p>Hi and welcome to the most useful resource on the planet. As a man with a job in property maintainence, I've seen my fare share of toilet disasters caused by the introduction of some Unidentified Flushed Object (UFO) to the delecate plumbing ecosystem.</p>

						<h1>THINGS NOT TO FLUSH</h1>
						<p>According to Wikipedia, the word "plumbing" comes from the Latin plumbum for lead, as pipes were once made from lead. Lead was the metal that was most commonly used for plumbing systems, until shortly after world war II when the switch to copper took place.</p>
						<p>It's easy to toss stuff in the toilet, flush, and forget. But this not only negatively impacts the environment, but it's also painfully expensive to fix.
Below is a list of a few things not to flush down the toilet. Sometimes things just don't go down there. </p>
					</div>

							<div class="desc">
								<h1>FEMININE PRODUCTS</h1>
								<p>Some experts claim that flushing tampons and sanitary napkins causes the majority of household clogs. The reason is because cotton snags easily, and if your home's plumbing pipes have any cracks or root infiltration, the cotton can quickly get caught in the line. After a few flushes, buildup can occur and you'll have a clog on your hands. </p>

						<div class="flush_item">
							<div class="desc">
								<h1>PETS</h1>
								<p>Yes, pets. Goldfish are commonly flushed, but small rodents (hamsters and gerbils) are also found in sewer systems. They're sturdy and they create clogs; consider a proper burial.</p>

								<h1>DIAPERS</h1>
								<p>Yes, people really do try to flush diapers down the toilet, and it's more common than you might think. Diapers will clog a toilet, or an outgoing line, in a heartbeat. They should always go in the trash </p>

								<h1>OTHER THINGS</h1>
								<p>Other things not to flush: chopsticks, articles of clothing such as underwear or shirts, paper towel (this can clump together and create big problems).</p>

					<h1>TESTIMONIALS</h1>
					<p>&quot;This site is amazing! Without it I would be flushing random garbage down the toilet left and right, like my human instincts have me programmed to do! But now I have the knowledge and forethought to understand that some things go NOT in the toilet. Some things even go <i>ELSEWHERE!</i> Amazing.&quot;

					<p>&quot;I WILL NEVER USE ANY OTHER WEBSITE OTHER THAN THIS EVER AGAIN!&quot;
					<span class="name">Cameron Diaz</span></p>
					
					<p>&quot;The strangest toilet clog I've ever came across was a pair of chopsticks. This pair of chopsticks must have had kung-fu pre-installed because they gave those pipes a hurtin`. It took 2 days, an Executive Order from President Obama, the coast guard, and 5.1 million US dollars to get these chopsticks out. As well as a laser gun. Never again.&quot;

					<p>&quot;Not just regular lasers. <i>Diamond-Cutting</i> Lasers.&quot;
